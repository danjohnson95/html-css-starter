# HTML/CSS Starter Kit

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This starter kit is designed to help you learn the basics of HTML and CSS, without having to worry about server or compilation.

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    
    Node JS is a JavaScript runtime. You'll need this to be able to have your website appear in the browser, and to automatically update when you make changes.

* A text editor, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  This is what you'll use to edit your code.

## Installation

Download this starter pack and unzip it on your desktop.

Next, you'll need to access the terminal to start up your server.

#### macOS

* Open *Spotlight* by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>

* Type in `Terminal`

* Press Enter

#### Windows

* Open *Run* by pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>

* Type in `cmd`

* Press Enter

### Starting up your server

Now that you're in the terminal, you need to point the directory to where your starter kit is. Type in the following command for the operating system you're on, and press Enter.

#### macOS

`cd ~/Desktop/html-css-starter && npm start`

#### Windows

`cd C:/Users/DanJohnson/Desktop/html-css-starter && npm start`

Be sure to change the username here to your Windows username.

### Viewing your website

Your website will now be accessible from the browser from [http://localhost:3000]()! ðŸŽ‰

## Making Changes

The browser will automatically update when you save a file, so you can see your changes live.

There are two files you'll be working with:

* index.html

    This is your HTML which is the main building block to your website. It is used for defining what goes on your page

* main.css

    This is your CSS file where you define what your website looks like.
